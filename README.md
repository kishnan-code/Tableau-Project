### Strategic Recommendation 

1. Investment Strategy for Countries  
  Prioritize training in high-medal-density sports (e.g., Swimming, Track & Field). Analyze cost-per-medal metrics to optimize ROI. 

2. Gender Equity Roadmap 
  IOC should continue enforcing minimum gender participation quotas and promoting women's events globally.  

3. Talent Identification Models  
  Build athlete prediction models using repeat performer patterns to optimize early-stage talent pipelines.  

4. Sporting Evolution Monitoring  
  Conduct separate trend tracking for newly added Olympic sports to monitor disruption to legacy patterns.
